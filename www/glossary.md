### Description of Statistics

* **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC):** The ROC curve involves understanding the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds.

* **ROC Curve Shape:** The ROC curve is typically a plot of TPR (sensitivity/recall) on the y-axis against FPR (1 - specificity) on the x-axis. The curve represents the performance of the classification model at various decision thresholds. It's desirable for the ROC curve to be closer to the top-left corner, indicating higher TPR and lower FPR..

* **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** The AUC represents the overall performance of the model. It measures the area under the ROC curve and ranges between 0 and 1. A higher AUC indicates better discrimination power of the model, where 1 represents a perfect classifier and 0.5 represents a random classifier.

* **Precision:** Proportion of correctly predicted positive instances. (How many of the predicted positives are actually positive?)

* **Recall:** Proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified by the model. (How many of the actual positives were identified correctly?)

* **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions.	(How many of the predictions were correct?)
