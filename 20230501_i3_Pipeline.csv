- Lt Col Moore and Maj Fickert visited on 19OCT.  During discussion, both expressed a desire to get VTS style content into their MQ1/MQ9 CAT/CWD effort.   Peter Jacob (Air Combat Command), told Lt Col Moore and Maj Fickert that the purpose of the demo was to see what CAT/CWD could be in the next contractual effort.  
- MAJ Peck (16th TRS) expressed a strong interest in i3 being responsible for training.  Said current prime, CTI, was not making the grade.  
- Lee Rinna to call Thomas Cotton at Wright-Patterson AFB to gain better understanding of collective bargaining requirements and best small business partners.  
RFI not yet released.  Expected in Aug. Remainder of funding cut on MQ-9 Program so this maybe why. Still on search for potential CAT small business partner who does union.
