Peter Jacob (Air Combat Command), told Lt Col Moore and Maj Fickert that the purpose of the demo was to see what CAT/CWD could be in the next contractual effort.  
- MAJ Peck (16th TRS) expressed a strong interest in i3 being responsible for training.  Said current prime, CTI, was not making the grade.  
- Lee Rinna to call Thomas Cotton at Wright-Patterson AFB to gain better understanding of collective bargaining requirements and best small business partners.
